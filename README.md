### Prime Directive

The standards herein are a guide to keep developers at the Nerdery interoperable amongst each other and able to produce the highest quality code given the timeline and budget constraints of a project.

For a successful project, always favor solutions that benefit the project and end users over producing "perfect code".

Always aim to meet the standards knowing you'll have to break the rules at some point. Be thoughtful about when you deviate and check with a senior software engineer or a principal software engineer for guidance.

### Expectations

* Understand and follow the standards outlined in this document.
* Understand and follow the [methodology](/standards/methodology.md/).
* Write code knowing that someone else might be maintaining it.
* Select tools that benefit the project.

### Goals

Strive to make your code:

* semantic
* accessible
* predictable
* reusable
* flexible
* resilient
* understandable
* scalable
* performant
* maintainable
* interoperable
